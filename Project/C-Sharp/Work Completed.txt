1) Opened FerryLegacy.sln
2) Ran executable file for FerryLegacy
3) Displayed bookings, ferry departures, ports, made bookings (just tested all the available operations)
4) Looked into code
5) Saw multiple objects that could be combined (Ex. Booking -> Object , Bookings -> ??? , JourneyBookingService -> Actually the booking functions)
